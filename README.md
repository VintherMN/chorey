## But why?
So, i have ADHD - and i found myself spending a lot of time and energy on evaluating when i needed to do tasks in the house - caught in "is there enough dust and dirt on the floor for me to vaccume, or is it barely noticable", "when was the last time i cleaned the windows?" - anyway you get the gist. A couple of times i have also had to turn the car around because i realized 20 minutes after driving off, that i had forgotten to take my medicine, so yeah...
So all in all, its an attempt to let something else think for me, so that i can use my ressources elsewhere in my life - my thoughts are, that my life will become easier, if i just follow my robot overlord, and use the memory of my phone instead of trying to evaluate what to do. The hopes is that this will train my subconciousness to know when tasks have to be done, and make it a natural occurence.

Also, i havent touched front-end development for a couple of years, so i figured i wanted a small project to brush up on some old skills.

TLDR; I made this app for myself, to help me remember my meds and keep track of housechores through planned intervals for every housetask.
